I’m a Full Stack Developer with a background in Computer Science and hands-on experience building web applications with a focus on performance, clean architecture, and real-world impact. I specialise in using modern technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Python, Java, and SQL to create scalable and user-friendly solutions.

My experience spans both frontend and backend development, working with tools like JavaScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and C++. I also have a strong interest in machine learning and natural language processing, with experience in deep learning using tools like TensorFlow (LSTM, Embedding, Bidirectional), Keras, NLTK, and Scikit-learn for model training, preprocessing, and evaluation.

Beyond code, I’m passionate about continuous learning and collaborative problem-solving. I enjoy applying technology to solve practical challenges and bring meaningful ideas to life. Outside of work, I enjoy playing and watching football, travelling, and exploring photography.
