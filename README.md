#  Hi, I'm Peter Gyamfi

Hello! I’m a passionate Software Engineer with a strong interest in full-stack development and machine learning. I bring a combination of technical depth and creative problem-solving to every project I take on.

As a developer, I enjoy building scalable and meaningful web applications that focus on performance, clean architecture, and user experience. My core expertise includes JavaScript, Python, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, SQL, C++, Java, Git, GitHub, and Machine Learning. I’ve worked on full-stack projects ranging from weather apps with CRUD functionality to sentiment analysis platforms using BiLSTM and FastAPI.

Outside of coding, I’m constantly learning and expanding my skill set, whether it’s exploring data science concepts, diving deeper into backend systems, or improving UI/UX design. I believe in collaboration, continuous growth, and creating tech that solves real-world problems.

I’m open to junior developer roles, internships, and freelance collaborations. Let’s connect and explore how we can build something impactful together.

Skills: JavaScript, React.js, Python, Node.js, SQL, HTML, CSS, Next.js, FastAPI, C++, Java, Machine Learning, Git, GitHub, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas.
